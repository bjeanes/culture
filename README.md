A lot of this is super-idealistic but over time can be toned back closer to reality. 
For now, it serves as a place to collect thoughts and start discussions. There are no 
holy cows here, and everything is up for discussion or change. I'm very interested in 
collecting others opinions, criticisms, experience, and resources.

Premise
=======

Creative/knowledge-based professionals excel in certain kinds of environments. How communication happens,
leadership forms, and decisions are made all have a huge impact on the ability to do a good job for such
professionals.

Culture
=======

Culture isn’t created by fiat. However, culture is created and re-created by the choices made by individuals every day.
It can be reshaped by conscious effort applied gently, subtly, and consistently (paraphrased from [comments here](http://37signals.com/svn/posts/3450#all_comments)). 
People make the culture, so invest in your people foremost.

Ethos
-----

### General

* Make the right thing to do the easiest thing to do.
* Solve problems by fixing the environment that allowed them to occur.
* Automate all the things!
* The worst thing we can do for happiness and productivity is disturb the culture. 
  The worst thing we can do to the culture is introduce tension.
  * There are better battles to fight than with each other. 
  * It's hard to say objectively that one culture is "better" than another, but having the culture pulled in multiple directions clearly burns people out, so focus on cultural alignment in decisions and hiring.
* Plan around trust; allow for mistakes
  * If tempted to introduce a policy, ask whether or not it is needed because you don't trust everybody to do the right thing.
  * Mistakes are OK; expect them and learn from them.
* Transparency & Communication
  * Lack of transparency alienates people and fosters resentment. 
  * Being upfront about risks, drawbacks, failings, etc., shows trust and fosters loyalty.
* Collaboration

### People

* Happiness is productivity is happiness — at least for people who care about what they do
* Responsible Autonomy
* People are the most important asset
* Never hire for growth/hiring targets; only hire for fit
* High cohesion, low coupling — ([Highly aligned, loosly coupled](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o3e1lnixKBM#t=136s))
* It doesn't matter when or how much you work, only that your peers trust you and feel like you are contributing fairly.

#### Leadership

* Leadership is not appointed/given, it is earned
  * You are a leader if and only if people follow you.
* leads/managers are not bosses
  * they are advocates
  * they are 3 steps ahead of team clearing obstacles
  * they inspire, not dictate
  * managers of people, not managers of process

#### Hiring

* Don't hire for teams. Hire great people, let them pick the team they want to be on.
  * Team can say no
  * Bad projects who can't compel people to join them will die. Let them.
* Hire for culture fit first, talent second
* Only hire people you can trust
  * Policies/procedures are created when you can't trust your employees — i.e. you made bad hires.

#### Compensation

* Pay them as much as you would pay them to keep them from leaving for a higher-paying job

### Considerations
* Culture aren't like prototypes, you can't through them away. How do you experiment to find the right culture?
* Being strict and intensive about hiring, but what about identifying bad hires and handling this once they're in?
* Companies with good 'chaotic' cultures seem to dogfood or have a close relationship with what they're building (eg Github). Is this a prereq for effective culture? This would mean that only engineer probs would get solved.
* What's the balance between hiring "culture-fits" to reduce cultural tension and forming a mono-culture?
